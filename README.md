This is a digital platform for sharing books in an organization. The project is created using the flutter SDK and firebase services. Google authentication is used for the validation of an account. Once the user is logged in then he/she can look for the available books uploaded by other students. Users can also see the contact details of donors and he/she can make a request for a book then E-mail is sent to the donor of the book with details of the requested user. Users can also contribute by adding their books.
